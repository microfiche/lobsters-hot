  <h1>Lobsters HTTP 502 status: server error</h1>
  <p>
    nginx tried to pass your request to puma but failed.
    This probably means we're in the middle of a deploy.
    If this persists for more than 120 seconds, please come hassle us in the
    <a href="ircs://irc.libera.chat/lobsters">IRC channel</a>
    (<a href="https://web.libera.chat/#lobsters">webchat</a>).

    <b>2024-06-27 note</b>:
    Well, probably it's not a deploy, it's the puma workers getting an OOM kill.
    We think it's probably a leak in <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/yjit">YJIT</a>
    so we're <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/m9ivcf/we_turned_lobste_rs_into_rails_benchmark">giving back</a>
    to the projects Lobsters is built on by experimenting and logging.
    The tracking issue is <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/issues/556">Shopify/ruby#556</a>.
